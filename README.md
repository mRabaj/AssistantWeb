# AssistantWeb
It is a website that allows users to register and connect according to their profile (patient or practitioner).

A patient user has access to a dedicated page where his profile is displayed, the agenda of all his appointments, the possibility to send documents and to contact his practitioners.
In addition to the functions of a patient user, a practitioner user can add new patients and view the list of all these patients.
